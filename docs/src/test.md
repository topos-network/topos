# Test

The tests are described using [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/), a language for [Behavior-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development).

The tests are located in the root folder `tests`.
Each file with the `.feature` extension implements the test scenario for each component.

Currently, the high level logical components are namely,
- Subnet
- TCE
- API
