# Integration tests

The tests are described using [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/), a language for [Behavior-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development).

Each file with the `.feature` extension implements test scenario.

This Gherkin [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete) is recommended for syntax highlighting and handy autocompletion.
