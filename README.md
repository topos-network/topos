## Tools

Some tools are implemented in this repository, namely,

The [params-minimizer](./params-minimizer/) aims at figuring out the protocol parameters of the TCE. Specifically, the TCE runs on simulated environment, with various parameters in order to understand what are the optimal values.

The [cert-spammer](./cert-spammer/) aims at spamming a deployed TCE network with a constant load of dummy Certificate.
