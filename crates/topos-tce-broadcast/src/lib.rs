//! Implementation of Topos Reliable Broadcast to be used in the Transmission Control Engine (TCE)
//!
//! This crate is designed to be used as a library in the TCE implementation.
//! It covers the Reliable Broadcast part of the TCE, which is the core of the TCE.
//! It doesn't handle how messages are sent or received, nor how the certificates are stored.
//! It is designed to be used with any transport and storage implementation, relying on the
//! `ProtocolEvents` and `DoubleEchoCommand` to communicate with the transport and storage.
//!
//! The reliable broadcast allows a set of validators to agree on a set of messages in order to
//! reach agreement about the delivery of a certificate.
//!
//! Each certificates need to be broadcast to the network, and each validator needs to
//! receive a threshold of messages from the other validators.
//! The thresholds are defined by the `ReliableBroadcastParams` and correspond to the minimum number of
//! validators who need to agree on one certificate in order to consider it delivered.
//!
//! This crate is responsible for validating and driving the broadcast of every certificates.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! The input of the broadcast is a certificate to be broadcast. It can be received from
//! the transport layer, or from the storage layer (from the pending tables).
//!
//! The transport layer can be anything from p2p network to API calls.
//!
//! Other inputs are the messages received from the transport layer, coming from other validators.
//! They're `Echo` and `Ready` signed messages.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! The outcome of the broadcast is either a certificate delivered or a failure on the delivery.
//!
//! The implementation is based on the paper: [Topos: A Secure, Trustless, and Decentralized Interoperability Protocol](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03481.pdf)
